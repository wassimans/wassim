# Hey there, I'm Wassim 👋

I'm a passionate software engineer with years of professional experience building both back-end and front-end systems for dynamic startups. My journey in tech has taken me from crafting robust APIs to designing sleek user interfaces—but somewhere along the way, I discovered my true passion: trust-less computing, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), and blockchain. 🚀

## What I Do

I love building systems that are open, verifiable, and truly decentralized. Blockchain isn’t just a buzzword for me—it’s a way to empower users and foster trust in an increasingly digital world. Whether it's writing smart contracts, architecting scalable back-ends, or exploring the next big protocol, I'm all in.

## Current Adventures

Right now, I'm diving deep into the Polkadot ecosystem, contributing to innovative projects that are reshaping the web:

- **[JAMIXIR](https://github.com/jamixir)**: An Elixir implementation of the JAM protocol, bringing the power of trust-less computing to the Elixir community. 🔥
- **[Polkadot-SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)**: Helping build tools and libraries to streamline development in the Polkadot ecosystem. 🌐
- **[ScholarLedger](https://github.com/ScholarLedger)**: a blockchain-based platform designed to support the peer review process for academic institutions. 🏫

## Fun Stats & Tidbits

- **Years in Software Development:** 10+ years  
- **Tech Stacks:** Elixir, Rust, JavaScript, and more...  
- **Favorite Emoji:** 🔐 (because secure, trust-less computing is my jam!)  
- **Philosophy:** Code should empower, not obscure. I strive to build systems that are as transparent as they are powerful.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, blockchain enthusiasts, and curious minds. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](#) or drop me a line via email at [you@example.com](mailto:you@example.com).
